# Your First Screen

With HK Frontend [installed](Install.md), the Setup Assistant asks a few
questions about your home and makes your first screen. About ten minutes.

## Run the Setup Assistant

Open **HK Settings** in the sidebar. The first time you open it — before any screen has HK Frontend settings — the **Setup Assistant** starts by itself. You can run it again at any time from **Overview** → **Setup Assistant**.

It asks a few questions about your home, then makes your first screen. Every control saves as you change it, and everything can be changed later from the list in HK Settings. Where a step links to another page (for example the radar map’s options), **Back** returns you to the step.

| Step | What it asks |
|---|---|
| **Welcome** | Nothing. Select **Get Started**. |
| **General** | **Alarm Panel** — the alarm the header, the Security chip and page, and the keypad use. If you have one, a button offers it. **Indoor Temperature** (default: the first thermostat’s reading) for the Climate chip. **Power Use**, a power sensor for the Energy chip. **House Timers** — timer helpers offered as one-tap timers on the Timers page. |
| **Weather** | **Weather Service** (default: the first weather entity), and **Place**, the name shown above the temperature (default: your home’s name). Optionally, **Sensors** that replace the weather service’s own readings, and the **Radar Map** (needs Weather Radar Card from HACS). |
| **Appearance** | **Glass Style** for tiles, pills and chips: *Clear* (the default), *Frosted*, *Blur* or *Blur Each Card* — the last is too heavy for a wall tablet. **Frost** or **Blur** amount for the style you picked. A switch for the **detail sheets** that open when you tap an accessory (on by default; off uses Home Assistant’s own dialog). |
| **Features** | The four optional features. One you have added links to its settings; one you haven’t shows **Set Up** and a line about what it does. You can also add them later — see [What next](#what-next). |
| **First Screen** | Your first screen — see the next step. **Skip** leaves it for later. |
| **Done** | A link to open the screen you made, and **Done**. |

## Make your first screen

A **screen** is a Home Assistant dashboard that HK Frontend has settings for. There are two ways to get one, both in the **First Screen** step or, later, from **Add Screen** in the HK Settings list.

### A new generated screen (recommended)

Under **New Screen**:

1. **Name** — for example `Kitchen`. It becomes the dashboard’s title in the sidebar.
2. **Shown On** — what the screen is for. It sets the starting values, and every one can be changed afterwards:

   | Shown On | Starts with |
   |---|---|
   | **Wall Tablet** | The menu always open with the time and weather in it, back to Home when idle, no Home Assistant header or sidebar. |
   | **Phone or iPad** | The menu behind a button, the time and weather in the header. |
   | **Computer** | The menu open beside the page. |
   | **Car** | No menu, sized for a car’s browser. |
   | **Something Else** | The defaults. |

3. **Only Admins Can Open It** — off, unless the screen is for admins only.
4. Select **Create Screen**.

HK Frontend creates a new dashboard (its address is `/hk-` followed by the name, for example `/hk-kitchen`), adds it to the sidebar, and gives it its settings. The dashboard’s whole configuration is one line:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:hk-dashboard
```

That line asks HK Frontend to build the screen every time it opens, from your floors, areas and devices. When you move a device to another area or rename an area, an open screen rebuilds itself.

**What you should see:** open the screen (from the Setup Assistant’s last step, or from the sidebar). The Home page shows the time and weather (in the header, or in the menu on a wall tablet), a row of status chips, and a section of tiles for each room, ordered by floor and then by name. Tapping a chip opens its page — Lights, Climate, Doors & Windows and so on — and tapping a room’s heading opens that room’s page.

### An existing dashboard

Under **Existing Dashboards**, HK Settings lists the dashboards that don’t have HK Frontend settings yet. Pick one, choose what it’s **Shown On**, and select **Set Up Screen**.

The dashboard itself isn’t changed: it gets a page in HK Settings for its menu, appearance and behavior. To look the part, its views should use cards from the [card library](Card-Library.md) and the HK Kiosk theme — choose **HK Kiosk** as each view’s theme in the view’s settings. On a hand-built dashboard the menu starts off unless the **Shown On** choice turns it on.

## Run Setup Check

Setup Check reads your Home Assistant and lists what is ready and what to fix. It changes nothing.

Open **HK Settings** → **Overview** → **Setup Check** (it is also under **System** in the list). Lines are grouped into **Needs Doing**, **Ready** and **Notes**. Fix everything under *Needs Doing*; the *Notes* are optional. Select **Check Again** after fixing something.

What each line means, and how to fix it: [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md#setup-check).

**You’re done.** What’s left is optional.

## Optional: Apple’s font and glyphs

Until you add them, screens use Home Assistant’s font (Roboto) and Material Design icons. Apple’s license keeps SF Pro and SF Symbols out of the integration, so you make your own copies from Apple’s downloads and put them in a folder under `/config` — `/config/hk_local` unless you choose another:

| File in `/config/hk_local` | What it is | Made from |
|---|---|---|
| `fonts/SF-Pro.woff2` | The font, as a web font | `SF-Pro.ttf` from Apple’s [SF Pro](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) download, with `tools/font/make_woff2.py` |
| `fonts/SF-Pro.ttf` | Or the font as Apple ships it, instead of the woff2 | The same file, copied as is |
| `iconset/hk-glyphs.js` | Every `hk:` icon and the weather symbols | 155 symbols from Apple’s [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) app, with `tools/sf_symbols/build_glyphs.py` |

Of the 46 files Apple’s SF Pro installs, use only `SF-Pro.ttf` — not `SF-Pro-Italic.ttf` and none of the `.otf` files. The glyphs need a Mac once, to run the SF Symbols app; the font doesn’t.

The step-by-step guide, including how to do it without a Mac or without Python on the Mac: **[Your files](Your-Files.md)**. The symbol behind every icon: [Glyph names](Glyph-Names.md).

## What next

- **Shape your screens:** the menu, the Home page’s chips, cameras, scenes and favorites, which pages to show, per-screen appearance — [Screens](Screens.md) and the pages under it. How HK Settings works — [HK Settings](HK-Settings.md).
- **Optional features** — Music, Live TV, Clean Areas and Alarm PIN. Add each from **Settings** → **Devices & services** → **HK Frontend** → **Add feature**, then set it up under **Features** in HK Settings: [Features](Features.md).
- **Wall tablets:** Fully Kiosk Browser, a user per tablet, the photo screensaver and returning to Home when idle — [Wall tablets](Wall-Tablets.md).
- **The live sky** and its seasonal decorations — [Live Sky](Live-Sky.md).
- **Timers you set from the Timers page** need a set of timer helpers that come with the integration: `helpers/quick_timers.yaml`, included as a package. The top of that file says how.
- **Your own dashboards** with the same look — [Card Library](Card-Library.md).
- **Something not right?** [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md).
