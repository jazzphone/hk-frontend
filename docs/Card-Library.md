# Card Library

HK Frontend’s screens are built from its own Lovelace cards, and every one of
them is yours to use in a dashboard you write yourself. This page lists each
card with what it is for and its main options; the view type and the
strategies are on [Strategies and Grid View](Strategies-and-Grid-View.md), and
complete examples on [Card Examples](Card-Examples.md).

You don’t need any of this for a generated screen: HK Settings builds those
(see [Screens](Screens.md)). Read on if you write dashboards in YAML, or want
an HK card on a dashboard of your own.

## Using the cards

- The card files are added as dashboard resources for you (see
  [Install](Install.md)). There is nothing to install per
  card.
- In the card picker, HK Frontend’s cards are the ones whose names start with
  **HK**. Every card has a visual editor and a sensible starting config.
- In YAML, a card’s type is `custom:` and its tag, for example
  `type: custom:hk-light-card`.
- Icons named `hk:…` are drawn from your own glyph file (see
  [Your files](Your-Files.md)). Until it is there, each `hk:` icon is drawn as
  the Material Design icon of the same name, and any `mdi:` icon works too.
- A card with no entity of its own falls back to what HK Settings chose (the
  weather entity, the alarm panel), so one card works on every dashboard.

### Colors

Wherever an option takes a color (`icon_color`, `color`), you can use a name:
`yellow`, `orange`, `blue`, `green`, `red`, `purple`, `pink`, `teal`, `cyan`,
`brown`, `gray`, `mint`, `white` or `black`. These are the Home app’s own
shades. Any CSS color works too, such as `rgba(255, 159, 10, 0.95)`.

### Actions and taps

`tap_action` (and `icon_tap_action` on tiles) take Home Assistant’s usual
actions: `more-info`, `toggle`, `navigate`, `perform-action`, `url` and `none`,
with an optional `confirmation`. Two things differ:

- **No hold.** A long press does what a tap does. There is no `hold_action`.
- **A right-click opens detail.** With a mouse or trackpad, right-clicking a
  tile (or Control-clicking on a Mac) opens its detail sheet, whatever its
  `tap_action`. A tile with no entity keeps the browser’s menu. A finger’s long
  press never does this.
- **Some things never change from one tap.** A `toggle` on a lock, an alarm
  panel, a valve, a thermostat, a water heater, a siren, a vacuum, a camera, or
  a garage door, gate or door (a cover of that device class) opens its detail
  sheet instead, whatever the card says.

A `navigation_path` that starts with `./` is relative to the dashboard it is
on (`./lights`), so one card works on every dashboard. A path that is a hash
(`"#garage"`) opens that pop-up.

Tapping an accessory opens its **detail sheet**, HK Frontend’s own
replacement for Home Assistant’s more-info dialog. Turn them off for every
screen with **HK Settings → Appearance → HK Detail Sheets**, or for one card
with `detail: false`.

## Tiles

The pill-shaped accessory tiles. All of them take the shared options below and
add a few of their own.

| Card | What it is |
|---|---|
| `hk-tile-card` | A tile for any entity: icon, name and a status line. A button or input button (a computer’s Wake on LAN, say) lights for a moment when tapped. A generated Wake on LAN tile wakes the computer from its glyph and opens its sheet from its name. |
| `hk-light-card` | A light; the status is its brightness. |
| `hk-fan-card` | A fan; the status is its speed, and the icon spins while it is on (`animation: none` stops it). |
| `hk-cover-card` | A blind, shade or garage door; the status is how far open it is. |
| `hk-media-card` | A TV or speaker; the status is what it plays or its input. `label_mode: source_first` puts the input first. |
| `hk-favorite-card` | A tile with the room’s name above the entity’s, for a favorites row (`room`). |
| `hk-tall-card` | A double-height tile, like the Home app’s locks and garage doors. Give it `view_layout: {grid-row: span 2}` in a grid. |
| `hk-climate-card` | A favorites tile for a thermostat, with the current temperature where the icon goes (`room`). |
| `hk-climate-tall-card` | The double-height version, lit while the system runs. |
| `hk-scene-card` | A scene, script or automation: tap to run it; it shows a ring while it runs. `entity` is optional (a pill that only runs its `tap_action`); `elevated` adds a shadow. |

**Shared tile options**

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `entity` (required) | The entity. |
| `name` | Defaults to the entity’s name. |
| `icon` | An `hk:` or `mdi:` icon. |
| `icon_states` | An icon per state, for example `{"on": hk:lightbulb-on}`. Quote `"on"` and `"off"`: bare, YAML reads them as true and false. |
| `icon_color` | The tile’s color: the icon’s circle while on, the icon itself while off (see [Colors](#colors)). The default follows the domain: yellow for lights, blue for fans and covers, and so on. |
| `icon_size` | A CSS size, for example `30px`. |
| `bare_icon` | While on, draw the icon without the colored circle behind it. `bare_icon_color` colors it. |
| `well_background` | The icon circle’s color, for example `transparent`. |
| `size` | `tall` or `regular`: the tile’s height, over the card’s own (a light as a tall tile, a lock as a pill). A tall tile is two rows high, so give it `view_layout: {grid-row: span 2}` in a grid. |
| `label` | Fixed status text, replacing the automatic one. |
| `label_mode` | How the state becomes the status text (below). |
| `group`, `group_lit` | Other entities this tile stands for, and whether it lights with the main entity (`entity`) or with any of them (`any`). |
| `tap_action` | Default: open the detail sheet. |
| `icon_tap_action` | What a tap on the icon does; the rest of the tile uses `tap_action`. The light, fan and cover tiles start with `toggle`. |

**`label_mode`**

| Mode | Status text |
|---|---|
| `on_off` | On when on; Off for anything else. |
| `on_off_sentence` | On or Off, else the state as a sentence. |
| `state` | Open, Closed, Locked, Unlocked and so on, else the state in title case. |
| `sentence` | The state as a sentence (“Heat cool”). |
| `title` | The state in title case (“Heat Cool”). |
| `open_closed` | Open / Closed for a contact sensor. |
| `leak` | Leak Detected / Dry, and No Report for a sensor that has not reported. |
| `alarm` | Home, Away, Night, Vacation, Off, Triggered… |
| `brightness` | A light’s brightness, as a percentage. |
| `position` | A cover’s position: Open, Closed or a percentage. |
| `humidity` | What a humidifier is doing: “Raising to 45%” or “Lowering to 45%.” |
| `vacuum` | Cleaning, Returning, Paused, Ready or Error. |
| `duration` | A timer’s length, for example “10 min.” |
| `group_brightness` | The average brightness of the lit lights in `group`. |
| `group_count` | How many of `group` are on (“3 On”). |
| `setpoint` | A thermostat’s target (“72°”, or “68°–74°”). |
| `setpoint_verb` | The target with what it is doing (“Cool to 72°”). |

For anything else, `label_map` maps states to text, and `label_default` is
the text for any other state (`sentence`, `title` and `spaces` transform the
state instead).

## Status chips and rows

| Card | What it is | Main options |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-chips-card` | The row of status chips under the header. Which chips, their order, and which appear only when there is something to report come from the screen’s settings in HK Settings. | `chips`, `quiet` (the row when the screen’s settings name none), `extra` (your own chips: `[{after: <kind> or start or end, card: …}]`) |
| `hk-status-chip-card` | One chip: an icon and two lines of text. | `kind` (below), or your own with `entity`, `name`, `icon`, `label` |
| `hk-scenes-card` | The row of scene pills. Which scenes, and their order, come from the screen’s settings. | `scenes` (when the settings name none; empty: every scene, A to Z), `name` (the heading), `looks` (`{<entity>: {name, icon, icon_color, tap_action}}`) |
| `hk-toggle-card` | A text-only pill that lights when an entity is on, or equals `option`. | `entity` (required), `name`, `option`, `tap_action` |
| `hk-row-card` | A row of any cards that scrolls sideways. | `cards`, `lead` (a card pinned at the start, such as the menu button), `card_width`, `gap`, `phone_card_width`, `phone_gap`, `pad_top` / `pad_bottom` / `pad_left` / `pad_right`, `margin` |

**A chip of a kind.** `kind` is one of `weather_alert`, `security`,
`doors_windows`, `climate`, `lights`, `blinds`, `timers`, `vacuums`,
`speakers`, `water` and `energy`. The chip then counts what **HK Settings →
What Counts** finds for that kind, and fills in its own icon, name and text.
`quiet: true` shows it only while there is something to report.

**A chip of your own.** Point it at one entity, or build its text:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `entity` / `source` | The entity it reads. `source` can be a list, combined with `reduce: max`, `min`, `sum` or `spread`. |
| `attribute` | Read an attribute instead of the state. |
| `count` | Count entities instead: `{entities: [...], match: "on"}`, or `{music: true, match: playing}` for Music’s rooms. |
| `format`, `zero`, `one`, `decimals`, `scale`, `unit` | How a number reads: `format: "{v} Open"`, `zero: Closed`. |
| `label_map`, `label_case: title`, `fallback` | How a state reads. |
| `label_rules` | A list of rules; the first whose `when` passes gives the label. |
| `parts` | Several readings joined into one line (`join` sets the separator). |
| `icon_states`, `icon_color_states`, `icon_rules`, `icon_color_rules` | The icon and its color by state, or by rule. |
| `quiet`, `active` | With `quiet: true`, the chip shows only while one of the `active` conditions passes (a list of `when`s). |

A `when` compares one value: `state` (one or a list), `state_not`, `above` and
`below` (strict: `above: 0` means one or more), `at_least` and `at_most`
(inclusive), or `any_of` (a list of entities, any one of which is in `state`,
optionally on an `attribute`).

## Headings, readings and rooms

| Card | What it is | Main options |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-heading-card` | A section title. With `area`, it links to that area’s room page when the dashboard has one. | `name` (required), `area`, `navigation_path`, `chevron` (text after the title), `height`, `padding`, `grid_rows` |
| `hk-stat-card` | An icon, a caption and a large reading, with no background. | `entity` (required), `name`, `value_mode` (`temperature`, `power`, `runtime`, `cost`, `flow`), `icon`, `icon_color`, `value` (fixed text) |
| `hk-rank-card` | A tile with a large reading: a value, a percentage, or a device’s power use ranked against others. | `entity` (required), `name`, `mode` (`hero`, `pct`, `rank`), `power`, `stat`, `peers`, `icon_color_steps`, `label_entity`, `label_suffix`, `label_decimals` |
| `hk-room-status-card` | A room’s status line: temperature and humidity, then what is on, open or detected, read from its area. | `area` (required; one or a list), `items`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `entities`, `exclude`, `include` |

`icon_color_steps` is a list whose first match wins, for example
`[{above: 60, color: green}, {above: 25, color: yellow}, {color: red}]`.

`items` on the room status card chooses from `temperature`, `humidity`,
`outlets`, `blinds`, `fans`, `windows`, `doors`, `locks`, `garage`, `motion`,
`occupancy` and `leaks`. Empty follows **HK Settings → Rooms → Status Row**.
Temperature and humidity come from the area’s own related sensors
(**Settings → Areas**) unless you name them.

## Controls

| Card | What it is |
|---|---|
| `hk-thermostat-card` | A thermostat dial with the current temperature, target and mode buttons. |
| `hk-slider-card` | A slider for a `number` entity, such as a battery’s charge limit. |
| `hk-media-control-card` | A media player’s progress bar and volume slider. `parts: [progress]` or `[volume]` draws one; `members_map` tells it a sync group’s speakers so the volume can level them. |
| `hk-control-card` | Picks one of the above from the entity (`control` forces one). Prefer the named cards. |

They share `entity`, `name`, `icon`, `color` (a color name or any CSS color)
and `bare: true` (no glass background, for use inside a card that has one).
`entity_from: {music: true}` follows whichever player the screen’s music is
on, instead of a fixed `entity`.

## Header, clock and weather

| Card | What it is | Main options |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-header-card` | The wall header: clock, date and weather, beside the security summary. Tap the weather for the Weather page, the security summary for the alarm; on a screen with a menu, tap the clock to open the menu. | `weather_path` (default `./weather`), `alarm_path` (default `./alarm`) |
| `hk-clock-card` | The time and date on their own. | `date_format` (`weekday`, `monthday`), `time_size`, `ampm_size`, `date_size`, `color`, `date_color`, `shadow`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, `gap` |
| `hk-weather-strip-card` | The current temperature and conditions on one line. | `entity`, `main_size`, `detail_size`, `glyph_size`, `color`, `dim_color`, `shadow`, `margin`, `tap_action` |
| `hk-weather-band-card` | Current conditions with an hourly and a daily forecast. | `entity` (required), `hours` (12), `days` (8), `place`, `min_hour_col` (40), `min_day_col` (55), `plain` (no plate, white text), `narrow` (stood up, as on a phone), `now_width` (today’s column, 120 to 400 px; 300), `tap_action` |
| `hk-weather-tile-card` | A small tile for the wind, sunrise and sunset, the moon, or the UV index. | `variant` (required: `wind`, `sun`, `moon`, `uv`), `caption`, `entity`, `speed`, `gust`, `sun`, `phase`, `uv` |
| `hk-alert-card` | Severe-weather alerts from the NWS Alerts integration; shows only while one is active. | `entity` (required), `title`, `source`, `icon` |

The weather cards use the weather entity from **HK Settings → All Screens →
Weather** unless you name one. Columns that do not fit are dropped rather than
squeezed: `min_hour_col` and `min_day_col` are the narrowest they may be, in
pixels.

## Calendar

| Card | What it is | Main options |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-calendar-card` | The Calendar page: the month, the week or the day, with events to add, change and delete. | `view` (`month`, `week`, `day`) |
| `hk-calendar-pane-card` | Today’s events and the coming days’, as the screensaver’s calendar pane shows them. | `days` (2; 1 to 7) |

Both show the calendars in **HK Settings → All Screens → Calendar**, in their
colours ([Calendar](Calendar.md)).

## Layout

| Card | What it is | Main options |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-grid-card` | A CSS grid of cards. Every page is built from these. | `cards`, `layout` (below) |
| `hk-frame-card` | Any Home Assistant card, on HK Frontend’s glass. | `card` (required), `material` (`glass`, `none`), `margin`, `phone: hide` (leave it out below 640 px) |
| `hk-spacer-card` | Empty space of a set height. | `height` |
| `hk-back-card` | The round back button for a sub-page. | `parents` (`{<page>: <parent page>}` for a page not opened from the dashboard’s first view) |
| `hk-menu-button-card` | The round button that opens the menu. It draws only on a screen with the menu on; put it in a chip row’s `lead`. | `glass` |
| `hk-key-card` | A plain button with an icon or a word. | `name` or `icon`, `variant` (`glass`, `flat`, `filled`), `icon_color`, `fill`, `width`, `tap_action` |
| `hk-info-card` | A large icon with a title and two lines: the house’s climate, its security, or any entity’s state. | `variant` (required: `climate`, `security`, `state`), `name`, `icon`, `entity`, `label`, `icon_states`, `icon_colors`, `temperature`, `downstairs`, `upstairs`, `garage`, `tap_action` |

**`layout`** takes any `grid-*` and `place-*` CSS property, plus `margin`
(default `0px 4px 0px 4px`) and `padding`. Each child can place itself with
its own `view_layout` (`grid-column`, `grid-row`, `grid-area`), and every
child gets a `4px 4px 8px` margin. A grid of tiles uses:

```yaml
layout:
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, var(--hk-track, 192px))
  grid-auto-rows: 82px
  grid-auto-flow: dense
  grid-column-gap: 12px
```

Write the columns exactly like that and the grid follows HK Frontend’s screen
sizes: two columns on a phone, smaller tiles on an iPad held upright. A
sideways row of tiles does the same with `card_width: var(--hk-pill, 192px)`.

## Security, vacuums and timers

| Card | What it is | Main options |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-alarm-keypad-card` | A keypad to arm and disarm an alarm panel with a code. The code is checked by the alarm, never on the screen. | `entity` (default: **HK Settings → General → Alarm Panel**), `bad_code_entity` (only for a panel that fails silently on a wrong code) |
| `hk-vacuum-card` | A robot vacuum with its status, battery and four commands. | `entity` (required), `name`, `battery`, `room`, `progress`, `error`, `dock_error` |
| `hk-area-select-card` | Pick rooms by floor, then clean just those. | `floors` (empty: the rooms [Clean Areas](Clean-Areas.md) offers, kept up to date), `order`, `start_script` (a script of your own that receives `areas`, instead of Clean Areas) |
| `hk-timers-page-card` | The whole Timers page: quick start, running timers, house timers and the New Timer keypad. | `timers`, `house`, `presets` (up to six, in minutes; default `[5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60]`), `name_chips`, `quick_script`, `create_script`, `empty_text`, `tint` |
| `hk-timers-card` | Every running timer as its own tile, with a live countdown. | `timers` (`[{entity, label, glyph, label_entity}]`), `empty_text`, `tint` |
| `hk-timer-strip-card` | A compact row of live countdowns for the running quick timers. | `entity` (default `sensor.running_quick_timers`), `scale`, `fixed` (pinned to the bottom, for a screensaver), `plated`, `glass` |
| `hk-timer-new-card` | Type a duration, pick a name, start a timer. | `create_script` (default `script.quick_timer_create`), `name_chips` |

The quick-timer cards use the optional timer helpers that come with HK
Frontend (`helpers/quick_timers.yaml`); see
[Your First Screen](Your-First-Screen.md#what-next).

`floors`, when you write it, is a list of `{name, areas: [{id, name}]}`, and
`id` is the Home Assistant **area id**.

## Cameras and Live TV

| Card | What it is | Main options |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-camera-mosaic-card` | The camera strip: one camera live, the others as snapshots, in one scrolling plate. Tap a camera for its sheet. | `cameras` (`[{entity, name, option}]`), `selector` (an `input_select` whose option picks the live camera; `option` matches a camera to it), `height`, `refresh` (seconds between snapshots, default 10; 0 stops them), `seam`, `radius` |
| `hk-doorbell-card` | One camera live **with its sound**. With a speaker, a hold-to-talk button. | `entity` (a camera), `name`, `speaker`, `live` (stream as you speak, for UniFi Protect doorbells; off: a recorded message played when you let go), `sound`, `aspect_ratio` (default `4x3`), `fill`, `tuning` |
| `hk-tv-guide-card` | The [Live TV](Live-TV.md) guide: every channel with what is on, and a tap that plays one full screen. | `title` |

When the screen’s settings in HK Settings choose cameras for its camera strip
(or the live camera), those win over the card’s own list.

Talking needs the page to be on **https**: browsers allow the microphone only
on a secure page.

## Music

These cards need the [Music](Music.md) feature. They follow whichever
room the screen is showing, so they name no speaker themselves.

| Card | What it is | Main options |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-now-playing-card` | Artwork, the track and controls for the screen’s music. | `music: true`, `meta_card`, `sub_card` (the controls under the title, usually `hk-media-control-card`s), `tall` (one column, for a narrow column or a phone) |
| `hk-speaker-picker-card` | Choose speakers, then tap a playlist. Also Move Music, Stop All and Clear. | `browse_url` (where its Browse Music pill goes, for example `./music-browse`; without it there is no pill) |
| `hk-library-card` | Browse and search the Music Assistant library, playing to the screen’s room. | `music: true`, `fallback_player`, `hide` (categories to leave out), `discover` (the first page’s rows) |
| `hk-screensaver-now-card` | What is playing, for a screensaver. | `music: true`, or `players` (in priority order, groups first) |
| `hk-browse-card` | Music Assistant’s own web player, framed in a page. | `port` (default 8095), `path` (default `/#/home`), `host`, `height` |

`hide` and `discover` default to **HK Settings → Features → Music → Browse
Music**.

## Energy

| Card | What it is | Main options |
|---|---|---|
| `hk-usage-card` | Today’s energy use or runtime against the last two weeks, with a bar chart. | `stat` (required: a sensor with long-term statistics), `name`, `compare`, `align` (`left`, `center`), `opts` (chart options, for example `{colour: orange}`), `height`, `entity`, `tap_action` |
| `hk-trace-card` | A line graph of a sensor’s last few hours, with its current value. | `entity` (required), `trace` (`{hours, colour, title}`; the key is spelled `colour`), `margin`, `tap_action` |
| `hk-battery-strip-card` | A home battery’s charge against its reserve and charge limit. | `entity` (required, percent), `name`, `stored`, `discharge`, `reserve`, `limit`, `margin`, `tap_action` |

## Pop-ups

A pop-up is a sheet over the dashboard that opens when the page’s address ends
in its hash (`#garage`), or by itself when its conditions are met. Closing it
takes the hash off the address.

Pop-ups you make in **HK Settings → Library → Pop-ups** work on every screen
with nothing on the page (see [Detail Sheets and Pop-ups](Detail-Sheets-and-Popups.md)).
The cards below are for a pop-up that belongs to one dashboard’s YAML. A card
on the page that claims the same hash as a Library pop-up wins.

| Card | What it is |
|---|---|
| `hk-popup-card` | One pop-up. It takes no space on the page. |
| `hk-popup-group-card` | Several pop-ups in one card, `popups: [...]`, each an `hk-popup-card` config (its `type` can be left out). Handy for one shared file. |

A pop-up belongs to the view it is placed in; on another view its hash opens
nothing.

**`hk-popup-card` options**

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `hash` (required) | | The address ending that opens it, for example `"#garage"`. |
| `cards` (required) | | The cards inside, as a list. They are built when it first opens and stop while it is closed (a live camera stops streaming). |
| `detail` | | Instead of `cards`: an entity whose detail sheet the hash opens. |
| `position` | `center` | `bottom` rises from the bottom edge. |
| `modal` | `true` | `false`: the page stays usable around it and is not dimmed. |
| `width`, `max_width`, `padding`, `radius` | `900px`, –, `18px`, `42px` | Its size and shape. |
| `background` | `#1c1c1e` | `transparent` shows the cards only. |
| `blur` | | A background blur, for example `40px`. |
| `backdrop` | `0.8` | How dark the page behind it is, 0 to 1. |
| `clip` | `false` | Clip the cards to its corners. |
| `vars` | | CSS variables for the cards inside, for example `{ha-card-background: transparent}`. |
| `auto_close` | | Close after this many milliseconds from the last touch in it, for example `60000`. |
| `close_outside` | `true` | A tap outside closes it. |
| `close_button` | `false` | Show a close button in its corner. |
| `trigger` | | Conditions that open it when they become true (below). |
| `trigger_close` | `false` | Also close it when they become false. |
| `dismissable` | `false` | Closed by hand, it stays closed on that screen until what it shows changes. |
| `dismiss_scope` | | What counts as a change for `dismissable`. |
| `close_action` | | An action run when it closes (not when switching to another pop-up). |

**Conditions** in `trigger` are a list, all of which must hold:

- `condition: state` with `entity`, and `state` (one or a list) or
  `state_not`. `grace: 20` keeps it true for 20 seconds after it stops being.
- `condition: numeric_state` with `entity`, `above` and `below`.
- `condition: and`, `or` or `not`, with `conditions`.

Instead of `entity`, `entity_from: {music: true}` follows the screen’s music.
