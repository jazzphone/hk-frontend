# Live TV

An HDHomeRun tuner’s channels, live with sound on your screens, with an
optional guide.

An HDHomeRun sends MPEG-2 video with AC-3 audio, which no browser can play,
and the tuner cannot convert it. So each channel you pick becomes a camera
entity whose stream is converted by ffmpeg on your Home Assistant host (to
H.264 video and AAC audio) and played through Home Assistant’s own go2rtc,
the same way any camera is.

## What you need

- An **HDHomeRun** tuner on your network, with a **channel scan** already run
  (in its own app or web page). You need its IP address.
- **ffmpeg** on the Home Assistant host. Home Assistant OS and the Home
  Assistant container include it.
- Home Assistant’s **go2rtc** integration, which `default_config` loads.
- Some processor to spare: one 720p channel uses about 0.8 of one core; 1080p
  uses about 40% more. Screens watching the same channel share one stream.
- Optional: an **XMLTV guide** file at an address Home Assistant can read
  (from a guide service or a grabber you run). Without one, the channels
  still play; they just have no “what’s on.”

## Set it up

1. **HK Frontend → Add feature → Live TV**.
2. Enter the **HDHomeRun address** (its IP address) and, optionally, the
   **Guide (XMLTV) address**.
3. Pick the **Channels** to show and the **Picture quality**: 720p
   (recommended) or 1080p.

A channel named by its station (“WXYZ-DT”) takes its network’s name
(“NBC”) when the guide says which network it is.

## What you get

| Entity | What it is |
|---|---|
| `camera.tv_<channel name>` | The channel, live. Its still picture is the current program’s artwork (or the channel logo), never a frame, so a thumbnail never ties up a tuner. |
| `sensor.tv_<channel name>_now` | What is on now (the state is the title; “Live” without a guide). Attributes: `channel`, `network`, `name`, `logo`, `camera`, and from the guide `subtitle`, `description`, `start`, `end`, `image`, `next_title`, `next_start`, `next_image`. |
| `sensor.tv_viewers` | How many screens are watching now. Attributes: `users` (the signed-in user on each) and `channels`. |

On generated screens, a **Live TV** page lists the channels with what is on
and how far through it is. Tap a channel and it plays full screen with sound;
close it to go back. The first picture arrives about six seconds after the
tap. Each channel being watched holds one of the tuner’s tuners, and the
tuner is freed about five seconds after the last screen stops watching.

While a channel plays, the screen reports itself as a viewer about once a
minute, and it stays on its page (Return to Home waits). A screen that stops
reporting drops out of `sensor.tv_viewers` after about two and a half
minutes.

## Settings

The **gear** on the Live TV item adds or removes channels, changes the
picture quality, and sets or clears the guide address. The tuner must be
reachable to open it.

**HK Settings → Features → Live TV** has the same settings, plus two that
the gear does not:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Channels | Those picked when the feature was added | Add or remove channels from the tuner’s lineup (**Shown** and **More Channels**). Tap a channel to **rename** it (up to 40 characters), or to use its network’s or station’s name. |
| Quality | 720p | **720p** or **1080p**. 1080p uses about 40 % more of Home Assistant’s processor for each channel being watched. |
| Tuner Address | Set when the feature was added | The HDHomeRun’s address, if it moves. The new address is checked before it is saved. |
| Guide Address | None | An XMLTV file (`http://` or `https://`), or empty for no guide. With a guide, each channel shows what’s on and uses the network’s name. |

Saving restarts the feature, the way its gear does. A channel you take off the
list takes its camera and “now” sensor with it.

## Keeping a tablet awake while someone watches

HK Frontend never turns a screen off. If you sleep your wall tablets with an
automation, add a condition so it leaves them on while TV is playing:

```yaml
conditions:
  - condition: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.tv_viewers
    below: 1
```

To keep only the tablet that is watching awake, test its user instead:
`"{{ 'Kitchen Tablet' not in state_attr('sensor.tv_viewers', 'users') }}"`.

## Notes

- **A channel that will not start**: check **Settings → System → Logs** for
  lines starting `channel <number>:`. An HTTP 503 from the tuner means all its
  tuners are busy (another app, or other channels).
- The guide is read every 30 minutes.
