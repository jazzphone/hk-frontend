# Alarm PIN

A PIN in front of an alarm that takes none.

Some alarm integrations arm and disarm for anyone who can call them: their
panel asks for no code (for example Honeywell Lyric). Alarm PIN adds a second
alarm panel that mirrors that alarm (its state, its availability, its arming
modes) and arms or disarms it **only with the right PIN**. A wrong PIN is
refused with Home Assistant’s own error, so every keypad says “Wrong code”:
HK Frontend’s keypad, Home Assistant’s alarm card, the companion app, and
voice.

## Set it up

1. **HK Frontend → Add feature → Alarm PIN**.
2. Fill in the form:

   | Field | Notes |
   |---|---|
   | Alarm to protect | Any alarm panel. Its own settings should take no code. |
   | PIN, PIN again | At least 4 characters, typed twice so a slip cannot be saved. Digits only gives keypads a number pad. |
   | Require the PIN to arm | On (default): arming needs the PIN too. Off: arming needs none, but a PIN that is given must still be right. Disarming always needs it. |

3. A new alarm panel appears, on a device named after the alarm with “PIN”
   added. For an alarm called “Home Alarm” it is
   `alarm_control_panel.home_alarm_pin`. Its `protects` attribute names the
   alarm it stands in front of.
4. Point your keypads at the **PIN panel**, not the alarm:
   - HK Frontend’s screens: **HK Settings → General → Alarm Panel** (the
     Alarm PIN page under Features has a button that does the same).
   - Home Assistant’s own alarm cards and your voice assistants.

Add Alarm PIN again to protect another alarm, with its own PIN.

**Automations can keep using the alarm itself.** It is unchanged, which also
means anything that calls it directly still arms and disarms it with no PIN.
Keep it off your dashboards and out of what you expose to voice assistants.

## Settings

The **gear** on an Alarm PIN item (“Front Door Alarm PIN”):

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| Alarm to protect | Choose another alarm to move the PIN and its panel to it. The PIN and the arm rule stay the same. |
| New PIN, New PIN again | Type a new PIN twice to change it. Leave both empty to keep the current one. |
| Require the PIN to arm | As above. |

**HK Settings → Features → Alarm PIN** lists every protected alarm, each with
**Change PIN**, **PIN to Arm**, **Protects** (move it to another alarm), its
**Keypad Panel**, **Use on All Screens** (shown when General → Alarm Panel is another panel; it points every screen at this PIN panel), and **Remove PIN**. **Add a PIN to an Alarm** protects
another one.

## The PIN is never stored

Only a salted hash of the PIN (PBKDF2-SHA256) is kept, and diagnostics leave
even that out. Nothing can show the PIN again, so a forgotten PIN is replaced,
not recovered: set a new one with its gear or on the HK Settings page. The PIN
is passed on to the protected alarm only if that alarm asks for a code of its
own.
