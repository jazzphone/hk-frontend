"""Generate the hk-sky textures. Pure Python -- no PIL, no numpy, no downloads.

WHY GENERATED AND NOT SOURCED
Apple's own sky is a Metal shader over fBm noise; there is no image to copy,
and a stock sky PHOTOGRAPH would fight the translucent glass plates for
contrast and would not tile or recolor. Noise generated here is tuned to the
sky's own palette, tiles seamlessly, and costs nothing to license.

OUTPUT (all tileable, all written to custom_components/hk_frontend/frontend/sky/)
  clouds-a.png   grey+alpha, low frequency   distant haze layer
  clouds-b.png   grey+alpha, mid frequency   main cloud deck
  clouds-c.png   grey+alpha, high frequency  near detail / parallax
  stars.png      RGBA                        night star field
  flakes.png     RGBA                        snow

  rain-b.png     RGBA                        far rain streaks

The cloud textures carry shape in the ALPHA channel only (luminance is a flat
255). They are used as CSS mask-image over a gradient-filled div, so the SAME
texture recolors itself from white noon cumulus to pink sunset to grey storm
without needing a variant per condition.

    gradient across 1280px steps visibly, and grain dithers those steps away.

    TWO OCTAVES, and they do different jobs. The fine layer is per-pixel
    dither. The coarse layer is a slow undulation, a few hundred pixels across,
    which is what stops the eye reading a uniform sandpaper texture. Fine
    alone looks like sensor noise; coarse alone looks like a stain.
