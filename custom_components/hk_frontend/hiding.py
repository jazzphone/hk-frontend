"""HIDDEN ACCESSORIES: everything that keeps an accessory off the screens, read
and changed in one place (HK Settings -> Accessories -> Hidden Accessories,
and Where It Shows on the accessory's own settings).

Before 2026-10-12 four separate settings each kept an accessory off a page,
and none said so where it was missing: Hidden from Screens, a kind's Left
Out list under Status & Chips (which decides the Climate, Security, Water...
pages as well as the chips), the accessory's Include in Status, and its Show
on Home. A water heater was off the Climate page with nothing on that page,
or on the accessory, saying why.

Each is now a PLACE an accessory can be hidden from, stored where it always
was -- nothing moves, so nothing is migrated:

    everywhere   generated.exclude_entities (and a whole device:
                 exclude_devices; a whole room: exclude_areas)
    home         the accessory's `home: False` (accessories.py)
    room         the accessory's `room: False` -- its tile left off its own
                 room's page (new)
    <kind>       counts.<kind>.exclude, Status & Chips' Left Out: that kind's
                 page and chip ("Climate": the thermostats)

The accessory's old Include in Status (`status: False`, out of every kind)
reads here as every kind it belongs to hidden, and is turned into those
places the first time the accessory is saved here.

`snapshot` says, for every accessory that can be hidden from anything, which
places it can be hidden from (`can`) and which it is (`off`); `plan` sets
one or several accessories to Everywhere, or to exactly the places chosen.

ALSO COUNTED (Status & Chips' Also count, counts.<kind>.include) is the other
direction, and on the accessory too (2026-10-12): a kind it isn't found in by
itself but could be counted in -- an outlet as a light, a camera that hears
the smoke alarm as Smoke & CO. `added` says which it is counted in that way;
`also` (for the accessories asked about) which it could be.
