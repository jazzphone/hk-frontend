"""Whole-home music: the configuration model and the request engine.

The engine plays a playlist (grouping the chosen speakers, or through a
preset's sync group), moves what is playing, stops, and runs the now-playing
buttons, with the measured timings in const.py. How it runs them:

  * PER-ROOM LOCKS. Each request locks exactly the rooms it touches, so two
    screens can work in different rooms at once, and overlapping requests (a
    Move and a regroup, say) go one at a time.
  * THE NEWEST REQUEST WINS. Each request stamps the rooms it wants; one that
    finds a newer stamp when its turn comes answers `superseded` and does
    nothing, instead of running a stale request after the one that replaced it.
  * WAITS ARE EVENTS. Every wait listens for the state change it needs (see
    _wait) instead of re-rendering a template. The one sleep left is
    JOIN_SETTLE, and const.py says why it cannot be an event.
  * EVERY REQUEST ANSWERS. {ok, leader} or {ok: False, message}, returned to
    the caller.
  * ONE LOG LINE per request, with who, what, where and how long (debug when
    it worked, info when it was refused or failed).
  * STOP CANCELS what is running for its rooms; the cancelled request answers
    "stopped".

Configuration comes from the Music feature (features/__init__.py Feature):
options (speakers, volume, each user's home room) and its items (presets,
playlists). Room names and floors
come from HA's area and floor registries, so there is nothing to type for them.
