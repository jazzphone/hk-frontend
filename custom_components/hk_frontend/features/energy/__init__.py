"""ENERGY: a generated Energy page, built from Home Assistant's own Energy
settings (Settings -> Dashboards -> Energy) -- the whole home's power and
today's cost, a fortnight of daily use for the devices that matter, and a
live tile for every circuit, room, appliance and outlet, in sections.

One per house. Nothing to set up first: a house whose Energy settings list
its devices gets a whole page when the feature is added. Its settings page on
HK Settings (Features -> Energy, settings_ws.py) then sorts the devices into
sections, names them, picks what the readings row and the daily bars show,
and adds what the Energy settings do not list (plan.py for the rules).

A screen shows the page when its Pages list it (the `energy` page kind,
hk-strategy.js energyPage); the "Energy display" screen preset is a screen
that is only that page. The plan goes to every screen in the settings feed
(`energy`, client()), worked out again when the options, Home Assistant's
Energy settings or the registries change.
