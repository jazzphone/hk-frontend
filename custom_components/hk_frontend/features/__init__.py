"""THE FEATURES: what HK Frontend adds beside the dashboards, each optional,
each an ITEM of the house's entry (a subentry of type "feature"), added with
Settings -> Devices & services -> HK Frontend -> Add feature:

    music        Music: whole-home music through Music Assistant
    live_tv      Live TV: an HDHomeRun tuner's channels, on the screens
    clean_areas  Clean Areas: "clean these rooms" for the house's vacuums
    alarm_pin    Alarm PIN: a PIN in front of an alarm that takes none
                 (one item per alarm)

WHY ITEMS, NOT ENTRIES. HACS installs one integration per repository, so the
features live in this one. Given more than one entry, Home Assistant's
integration page answers every "Add ..." button with a list of ALL of them to
pick from, whichever one the item belongs to (a dashboard offered to Live
TV). With one entry, every button opens its own form.

An item's data is {kind, data, options}: what a feature's own entry once held
as its data and options. Its code still reads it as an entry: a Feature
(below) is an entry-like view of the item -- entry_id, title, data, options,
runtime_data, async_on_unload -- whose data and options are read from the item
each time. Its entry_id is the item's id, which is also what its entities'
unique ids and its device are built from.

Each feature is a package here with the same shape:

    PLATFORMS                          the entity platforms it adds to
    RELOAD                             a change restarts it (its entities are
                                       rebuilt); otherwise async_changed
    ITEM_TYPES                         the house's item types it owns (Music's
                                       presets and playlists)
    async_setup(hass)                  once, at start: its actions and its
                                       websocket commands (so the settings page
                                       can ask even before it is added)
    async_setup_entry / async_unload_entry (hass, feature)
    async_changed(hass, feature)       a change, when it does not restart
    AddSteps / ReconfigureSteps        its steps in the feature item's flow
                                       (config_flow.FeatureFlow); every step id
                                       starts with the kind ("alarm_pin_...")

The house's entry starts the features when it is set up and follows its items
afterwards (async_sync, from its update listener): an item added starts, one
removed stops (Home Assistant removes its entities and device), one changed
restarts or is told.

(A pre-release of 1.0 made each feature an entry of its own; async_fold turns
such entries into items, once.)
