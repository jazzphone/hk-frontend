"""STATUS & CHIPS: the house's smoke and CO alarms, temperature and humidity
readings, lights, fans, doors, windows, garage doors, locks, blinds, leak
sensors, motion and occupancy sensors, valves, thermostats, timers, vacuums and
speakers -- FOUND, not listed.

A chip that must be told what to count -- a template sensor walking a list
of entities, or an entity list typed into its YAML -- counts nothing on a new
install. So nothing is listed by hand:

EACH KIND IS AUTOMATIC: every entity of that kind the house has, by domain and
device class, less anything hidden, disabled, a config or diagnostic entity,
a group of other entities (a light group would count its members twice), or
left out of HK everywhere (HK Settings -> Accessories -> Hidden from Screens).
HK Settings -> Status & Chips then adjusts each kind with two pickers -- Leave
out and Also count -- and an untouched kind stays automatic, so a new light is
counted the day it is added.

THE READINGS (temperature, humidity) feed the Climate page, not a chip, and
are found by room rather than by class -- a CPU's temperature is no room's: an
area's Related sensor (Home Assistant's area settings), else the area's
thermostat (its current_temperature / current_humidity). Other sensors of the
class come in only through Also count.

Resolved HERE, once, and handed to every screen as `kinds` (settings.as_client):
the chips, the header's security line and the generated pages all read the same
lists, so a chip can never say "3 On" while its page shows four.

AN ENTRY FROM AN OLDER VERSION may hold lists chosen before Status & Chips
(security's locks, doors, windows and garage; features' thermostats -- LEGACY).
It keeps exactly those until Status & Chips is saved: a kind with nothing saved
and an old list uses the old list as it is. The page offers that list as Leave
out / Also count against what it finds now, so saving it changes nothing that
is counted -- see suggest().
