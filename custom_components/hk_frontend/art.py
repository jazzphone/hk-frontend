"""ARTWORK THROUGH HOME ASSISTANT: album art for screens that cannot reach it.

Music Assistant hands out artwork as the ORIGINAL URL -- most of it
https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/... -- and a wall tablet kept off the internet
cannot fetch those: a firewall that allows the hosts by name does not help,
because the CDN answers each lookup with different addresses, and a tile
waits out its timeout on a placeholder (a direct load can hang 30 s).
Music Assistant's own /imageproxy/<id> will not help:
the id is sha256(provider_instance + "/" + url), the dashboard never sees the
provider instance, and an id MA has not stored is a 404.

So Home Assistant fetches it -- HA can reach the internet and MA's local
imageproxy both -- scales it to the size the tile draws, keeps it in memory,
and serves it from the page's own origin (https, no mixed content):

    ws  hk_frontend/art/sign  {urls: [...], size: 300}
        -> {signed: {url: "/api/hk_frontend/art?u=...&s=300&authSig=..."}}
    GET /api/hk_frontend/art?u=<url>&s=<px>&authSig=...

THE PATHS ARE SIGNED (async_sign_path, which signs the query too), because
HA is reachable from the internet and an unsigned "fetch any URL" endpoint is
an open proxy. Signing needs an authenticated websocket, so only a signed-in
screen can mint one; SIGN_HOURS bounds how long a painted tile keeps working.
(HA's signing secret is drawn at start-up and never saved, so every path dies
with a restart; hk-base.js forgets them on reconnect.)

ONLY PIXELS GO OUT. Whatever comes back is served from HA's own origin, so
what that origin serves must never be something a browser would RUN: an
upstream `image/svg+xml` (Pillow cannot read it, so passed through as it
came) opened as a page runs its script with HA's stored sign-in in reach. So a response is one of RASTER as it came, or a
JPEG this module encoded itself, always with nosniff and a sandboxing CSP --
anything else is 415. Re-encoding the rest (rather than refusing all of it)
keeps a BMP or TIFF cover showing, and what reaches the page is then bytes
Pillow wrote, not bytes a stranger chose. See render().
