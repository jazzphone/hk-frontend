"""Serve this component's own `frontend/` directory at /hk/.

WHAT THIS IS
The dashboard frontend -- the card library, the page modules, the icon set,
the font and the sky artwork -- lives HERE, next to the code that serves it,
rather than loose in /config/www. See docs/Card-Library.md.

WHY NOT /local/

    /local/ (the built-in mount of /config/www) sends
        Cache-Control: public, max-age=2678400        # 31 days
    and a URL is the only cache key a browser has, so a changed file at an
    unchanged URL can NEVER reach a wall tablet. The only way around it is a
    hand-maintained ?v= on every module, and a forgotten bump ships a stale
    module silently.

`no-cache` is the header that means what is actually wanted: cache it, but
revalidate EVERY time. With the ETag aiohttp already sends, an unchanged file
costs one conditional request answered by a bodyless 304 -- the caching benefit
survives, the staleness does not.

WHY A VIEW AND NOT cache_headers=False
cache_headers=False only OMITS Cache-Control; it does not force revalidation.
With no Cache-Control and no Expires a browser applies HEURISTIC freshness
(RFC 9111 4.2.2) -- roughly 10% of the age since Last-Modified -- so a
long-untouched file gets a LONG stale window: a tablet can run a weeks-old
hk-loader.js and never once ask for a newer copy.

An on_response_prepare hook or a middleware cannot do it either: aiohttp
freezes those once the app has started, so a custom component cannot add to
them during setup. Serving from its own view is what works at this point in
the lifecycle.

LAYOUT -- the URL is the path under frontend/
    /hk/cards/hk-tile.js        frontend/cards/     the Lovelace cards (+ hk-strategy.js)
    /hk/modules/hk-sky.js       frontend/modules/   page behavior, the loader
    /hk/iconset/hk-icons.js     frontend/iconset/   the hk: iconset loader
    /hk/pages/skyprobe.html     frontend/pages/     standalone pages
    /hk/fonts/sf-pro.css        frontend/fonts/     the @font-face (the font is yours)
    /hk/sky/clouds-a.webp       frontend/sky/       sky artwork

Everything else in this component (tests/, docs/, tools/, helpers/, theme/)
sits OUTSIDE frontend/ and is therefore unreachable over HTTP by construction,
not by a rule that could be forgotten.

EXPOSURE
Identical to /local/: unauthenticated, because the browser fetches Lovelace
resources and fonts with no auth header and they must be readable. Only
frontend/ and your files folder (files.py) are reachable. Do not put anything
in either that should not be public -- and no page there may trust its query
string: a page that frames its ?p= as given lets a crafted link run script on
this origin.

The other endpoints, all registered in async_setup, are NOT public:
  ws   hk_frontend/art/sign {urls, size}     art.py: signs the path below for
                                              24 h (an authenticated socket only)
  GET  /api/hk_frontend/art?u=&s=&authSig=   art.py: HA fetches an http(s) image
                                              (8 MB, 12 s, 25 MP), scales it,
                                              serves JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF only
                                              (anything else re-encoded to JPEG
                                              or refused), nosniff + sandbox CSP
  POST /api/hk_frontend/talk?entity_id=      talk.py: a hold-to-talk clip,
                                              played on that media_player
  GET  /api/hk_frontend/talk/<id>?authSig=   talk.py: the clip, for the
                                              speaker's ffmpeg (signed, 120 s)
  ws   hk_frontend/talk/live                 talk_live.py: the voice streamed
                                              to a UniFi Protect doorbell
Each requires a signed-in user or a path signed for one. So a signed-in
screen can have HA fetch an outside image and play a clip on a speaker --
nothing an anonymous request can do. HA's signing key is made afresh at every
start, so a signed path does not outlive a restart.

YOUR FILES (files.py)
A folder under /config, chosen in Configure -> Your files, answered AHEAD of
frontend/ at the same URLs. It holds what cannot ship here -- Apple's SF Pro
and the SF Symbols glyph data -- and anything a home wants to add or override.

INSTALLING
Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration -> HK Frontend. The config
entry is the whole install: Home Assistant runs async_setup for it, which
serves /hk/ and registers the bootstrap modules. (`hk_frontend:` in
configuration.yaml also works and serves /hk/ with no entry, but is not needed.)

THE CONFIG ENTRY (one per house, and the only one)
  * options -- the dashboard settings (settings.py) and your files folder;
  * items (subentries) -- each dashboard's settings, the pop-ups, custom
    pages and chips, the features, and Music's presets and playlists;
  * one entity of its own, on an "HK Frontend" service device: the Seasonal
    decorations switch.
The settings feed (hk_frontend/settings/subscribe) is registered in
async_setup, so it answers even while the entry is not loaded; so are the art
and talk endpoints (EXPOSURE) and the features' actions.
The features -- Music, Live TV, Clean Areas and Alarm PIN -- are items added
with Add feature (features/); the entry starts them and follows them. The
cards find them by their actions and feeds only. See docs/Features.md.
