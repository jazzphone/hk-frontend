"""Sleep Screen: WHEN a wall tablet sleeps and wakes -- the rules, pure.

No Home Assistant here: the settings' shape, what counts as "on", the
schedule, and `decide()`, which turns one moment's facts into what the
screen should show. sleep_engine.py gathers the facts from Home Assistant and
acts; the tests and the history replay call these directly.

The priority order is the one the house's generated tablets ran from 2026-09
(hk_house/generator/tablet_want_template.yaml; docs/TABLET-INVARIANTS.md),
each rule now a setting of the screen's Sleep Screen page:

   1 Wake for, in quiet hours too (smoke) ......... dashboard
   2 Quiet hours (the schedule, Quiet while) ...... dark -- unless in use,
                                                    another app is in front,
                                                    or a Hold while that
                                                    works in quiet hours is on
   3 Wake for ..................................... dashboard
   4 Hold while (the doorbell, the alarm) ......... hold: leave it as it is
   5 Another app is in front ...................... hold
   6 Keep awake while (Live TV) ................... dashboard
   7 Stay dark while (away) ....................... dark
   8 A presence sensor is missing ................. hold (no guess)
   9 In use (touched within the window) ........... dashboard
  10 Somebody in the room (Presence) .............. photos
  11 Nobody ....................................... dark

`photos` means "awake": a dark tablet wakes to the dashboard and the photo
screensaver comes up on its own (Starts After); an awake one is left alone.
