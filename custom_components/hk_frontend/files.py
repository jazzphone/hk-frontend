"""YOUR FILES: a folder served under /hk/ AHEAD of the bundled frontend.

Some of what these dashboards draw cannot ship with them. SF Pro and the SF
Symbols glyphs are Apple's, and Apple's license does not allow passing them on,
so each home supplies its own copies -- and they must survive an update, which
replaces this component's folder wholesale. So they live in a folder of the
user's choosing under /config (Settings -> Devices & services -> HK Frontend ->
Configure -> Your files), and a request for /hk/<path> is answered from
<that folder>/<path> when it exists there, and from frontend/<path> otherwise.

The URL never changes, which is the point: `/hk/fonts/SF-Pro.woff2` is the same
address whether the file comes from the bundle or from the folder, so moving a
file between the two is invisible to every page and every cached reference.

    <folder>/fonts/SF-Pro.woff2       (or SF-Pro.ttf, as Apple ships it)
    <folder>/iconset/hk-glyphs.js     the glyph data (tools/sf_symbols/)

Anything else placed there is served too -- a home's own probe pages, a
replacement texture -- and wins over the bundled file of the same name.

EXPOSURE. Like the bundle, the folder is served WITHOUT authentication (the
browser fetches fonts and modules with no auth header). So the folder must be
a dedicated one: `validate_folder` refuses /config itself, anything outside it,
a hidden folder or one inside it (.storage, .cloud, .ssh), Home Assistant's
own data folders (backups, custom_components, deps, ...), and any folder
holding secrets.yaml, .storage or configuration.yaml. And whatever the folder,
only WEB FILES are ever answered from it (`WEB_TYPES`): an extensionless
.storage/auth or a .yaml, .db or .key is a 404, never a download.
