"""Follow an entity rename through HK Frontend's own settings.

WHY. Settings name entities by id -- an accessory's name and icon, a
dashboard's favorites, the weather sensors, a pop-up's camera -- and a rename
in Home Assistant would leave every one of them pointing at an id that no
longer exists. The accessory settings would simply be lost.

WHAT IT MAY TOUCH, AND NOTHING ELSE (following a rename must never cause a
problem of its own):

  * Only a RENAME: an entity-registry `update` that carries old_entity_id, in
    the same domain. A removal, a new entity, a device change: nothing.
  * Only an EXACT value: a stored string equal to the old id, or a list
    element equal to it. Never a substring, never a pattern.
  * Only HK Frontend's own STRUCTURED settings, field by field:
      options   dashboard.<section>.<key> values and lists (counts.<kind>
                .include/.exclude one level down); weather.radar is skipped
      dashboard items   favorites, cameras, scenes, chips, chips_extra, camera_live
      pop-up items      entity, speaker, stream, entities
      feature items     the fields each feature names in its RENAME (Music's
                        speakers and homes, Clean Areas' vacuums, the alarm an
                        Alarm PIN protects -- whose unique id and title move
                        with it), and the items it owns (RENAME_ITEMS: a Music
                        preset's group and rooms)
      accessories store the entity's own settings (its key), fav_with, room
                        tile orders, page orders
  * NEVER the free-form card configurations -- a custom page's view (Energy,
    EcoFlow), a custom chip's card, a pop-up's own cards, a dashboard's
    wallpanel/kiosk options, the radar options -- where
    `select.select_option` (an action) looks exactly like an entity id. The old
    id found there is REPORTED, for a person to fix.
  * NEVER outside HK Frontend: YAML dashboards, automations, other
    integrations are Home Assistant's and yours.
  * NEVER over something: the new id already having accessory settings of its
    own is a conflict -- both are left as they are, and it is reported.

Everything changed and everything found but not changed goes in one persistent
notification, so a rename's effect can be seen and undone.
