"""THE THIRD-PARTY CARDS a generated dashboard uses, and whether
each is ready: installed from HACS and, where the card needs it, loaded as a
dashboard resource. Setup check lists them; the pages where each is set up
(Configure -> Weather, a dashboard's gear -> Screen) say when one is not
ready, so an options field is never a silent no-op.

    not_loaded  installed, but not a dashboard resource (WallPanel and Kiosk
                Mode only run as resources; the radar card is imported by the
                Weather page itself, so it never needs to be one)
