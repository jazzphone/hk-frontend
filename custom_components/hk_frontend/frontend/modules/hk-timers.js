// hk-timers.js - a live countdown a card cannot draw on its own.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// A card render is a pure function of hass, and it runs when one of the
// entities it watches CHANGES STATE (HkBase gates on last_updated). A running
// timer changes state exactly twice -- once when it starts and once when it
// finishes. In between, the only thing moving is the wall clock, and hass
// never fires. So a countdown drawn at render time is a number that is correct
// for one frame and then wrong for an hour, which is worse than showing
// nothing.
//
// hk-stats.js has the same shape of problem (data that arrives after a
// synchronous render) and solves it by waking the card. That is the wrong fix
// here: re-rendering a whole card every second, on a page that can hold thirty
// of them, on a wall tablet, is a lot of layout work to move one glyph.
//
// WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD
// Defines <hk-countdown>, a custom element that owns one text node and
// repaints only that. A timer card emits the element; this file keeps a single
// document-wide interval and writes to each live instance.
//
// WHY A CUSTOM ELEMENT AND NOT A querySelectorAll SWEEP
// These cards render into their own shadow roots, nested inside more shadow
// roots again (hui-view and friends). document.querySelectorAll cannot see any
// of it, so a sweep would mean walking every shadowRoot in the document once a
// second -- the expensive, fragile version of what the platform already does
// for free. Custom elements upgrade wherever they are constructed, shadow DOM
// included, and connectedCallback / disconnectedCallback give exact
// registration and, more importantly, exact CLEANUP: a card that rebuilds its
// subtree destroys instances constantly, and anything holding them by hand
// would leak one per render.
//
// THE INTERVAL RUNS ONLY WHEN SOMETHING IS COUNTING
// It starts on the first connect and stops on the last disconnect. On a
// dashboard where this module is loaded but no countdown exists, nothing ticks
// at all. Same reason the sky's poll is conditional.
//
// TAB VISIBILITY
// No visibilitychange handling on purpose -- but NOT for the reason that is
// easy to assume. MEASURED: the browser does NOT throttle the interval by
// itself here. The WallPanel screensaver is a DOM overlay in the SAME document, so
// `document.hidden` stays false and Chromium never throttles anything. This is
// the whole reason hk-sky has to take an explicit screensaver boolean instead
// of listening to visibilitychange; see the long note there.
//
// The real grounds for skipping it: the interval only
// EXISTS while a countdown does (start()/stop() below), and a tick is a few
// short-circuiting no-ops a second over a handful of elements. If that ever
// stops being true, the fix is the screensaver boolean, not visibilitychange,
// which would do nothing here. paint() also recomputes from the deadline
// rather than an accumulated count, so a throttled or missed hour costs
// nothing but a stale frame.

  var tick = null;

  // The whole point of the module, in one line: time is read from the
  // DEADLINE, never accumulated. A missed tick, a throttled tab and a
  // suspended tablet all self-correct on the next frame.
  //
  // `hold` is the PAUSED case and it takes priority. A paused timer has no
  // deadline -- it has a fixed number of seconds left that does not move until
  // somebody resumes it -- so there is nothing to compute and the interval must
  // not be allowed to walk it down. (Expressing pause as
  // "deadline = now + remaining" reads correctly for exactly one frame and
  // then ticks away merrily, because the card only re-renders on a STATE
  // change and pausing is the last one that happens.)
  // `since` COUNTS UP instead of down, and it is the same idea read the other
  // way: time comes from a fixed point and the clock, never accumulated.
  // It exists for the media player's elapsed time: rendered as TEXT it would
  // freeze while the progress bar beside it, a CSS animation, kept moving --
  // a track playing on visibly while "1:02" sat still until something forced
  // the card to re-render.
  //
  // `since` is the epoch ms at which the track was at 0:00, i.e.
  // now - position. Capped at `total` so a finished track reads its duration
  // rather than counting past it while HA catches up.
  //
  // `hold` still wins, and serves both directions: for a countdown it is the
  // seconds remaining on a paused timer, for this it is the seconds elapsed on
  // a paused track. Either way it is a fixed number the interval must not walk.
  function remaining(el) {
    // `!= null`, LOOSELY, catches undefined as well as null. A browser hands
    // back null for a missing attribute; not every host does, and reading a

      // width evenly however many there are, and a long name ellipsizes inside
      // its own column (the name already has text-overflow) rather than
      // pushing its neighbor off the end.

      // rules drawn on it. So the plate is on each ITEM, not on the ROW.

      // floats in the middle of a full-width pill with nothing anchoring it.
