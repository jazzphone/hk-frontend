// hk-stats.js - long-term statistics and history for the hk card set.
//
// THE CONTRACT: ASK SYNCHRONOUSLY, GET WOKEN LATER.
// A card's _render() is synchronous and its return value is drawn at once, so
// it can never await. Every function here is therefore a cache read that
// returns immediately -- the data if it is held, or null -- and starts a fetch
// in the background. When that lands, the cards that asked are woken and draw
// again from the now-warm cache.
//
// WHO GETS WOKEN. Whatever the caller passed as `card`. Nothing is discovered:
// no DOM walk, no shadow-root piercing, and a card that never called here is
// never touched. A card says when it is going away (see release/subsOf below).
//
// USAGE
//   const d = window.hkStats && window.hkStats.daily(hass, 'sensor.foo', 14, this);
//   if (!d) return 'Loading...';        // first render only
//   // d = [{ t: <Date, HA-local bucket start>, v: <kWh or null> }, ...]
//   //     oldest first, always exactly 14 entries, gaps filled with null so
//   //     bars line up with dates rather than sliding when a day is missing.

// BUCKETS ARE IN HOME ASSISTANT'S TIMEZONE, not the browser's -- see the long

// bucket uses the same zone it was cut in.
//
// BATCHING
// A popup full of usage cards renders in one pass, so every card calls in
// within the same tick. Requests are collected and flushed on a timer, which
// turns eight cards into ONE websocket call -- recorder/statistics_during_period
// takes a list of statistic_ids. Without this the energy popup would fire a
// dozen round trips every time it opened.

  // The recorder buckets `period: day` at midnight in HA's CONFIGURED
  // timezone. Verified: with America/New_York a day bucket comes back as
  // ...T04:00:00Z, which is midnight EDT, not midnight UTC and not midnight
  // anywhere else.
  //
  // An axis built with `setHours(0,0,0,0)` -- midnight in the BROWSER's
  // timezone -- that then matches rows by exact timestamp:
  //
  //     byTime.get(startOfDay(new Date(r.start)).getTime())
  //
  // works on a wall tablet, where the two zones are the same. On a phone in
  // another timezone NOT ONE KEY MATCHES, so every bucket stays null and the
  // chart is empty. That is the failure mode: not a shifted bar, a blank
  // chart with no error anywhere.
  //
  // DST IS WORSE, because it needs no travel at all. Stepping an hourly axis
  // with `t.setHours(t.getHours() - i)` is WALL-CLOCK arithmetic. Run across
  // the fall-back boundary (measured, America/New_York):
  //
  //     ...T05:00:00Z  local 01:00 EDT
  //     ...T07:00:00Z  local 02:00 EST      <- 06:00Z never appears
  //
  // The repeated 01:00 hour has a real recorder bucket at 06:00Z and such an
  // axis has no slot for it, so one hour of every fall-back night is silently
  // dropped, once a year.
  //
  // THE FIX IS THE SAME ONE TWICE: stop doing arithmetic on wall-clock fields.
  // Bucket boundaries are found by asking Intl where the boundary IS in HA's
  // zone, and stepping between buckets is done in absolute milliseconds. An
  // hour is always 3600000ms of real time; a day is 23, 24 or 25 of those, so
  // days step by re-flooring rather than by adding a constant.

  // refresh runs, so a revisit draws instantly.
  // notify() prunes as it goes, but it only runs when a fetch RESOLVES -- at
  // most once per HIST_TTL per key. Between fetches every render adds its card
  // again, so a page left on a chart view accumulates in between. Adding
  // through here keeps that bounded without walking the set on every render:

  // again is simply held until something else triggers a pass.

  // So a card says when it is done, from disconnectedCallback (see

  // there is no DOM scan anywhere -- the card tells us, we do not go looking.
