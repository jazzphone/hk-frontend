// hk-campost.js -- give the cameras page a poster it already has.
//
// THE PROBLEM, measured on a wall tablet. A cameras page is a grid of
// `picture-entity` cards with `camera_view: live`. Their <video>
// elements exist at 425ms, and HA sets a /api/camera_proxy poster on each one
// at the same moment -- but that poster has to be FETCHED, and UniFi Protect
// takes 1.6-3.1 seconds to produce a snapshot. The live stream usually wins
// (nine Protect cameras):
//
//     camera            HA poster    first video frame
//     front_door           1624ms          1158ms   <- video
//     driveway             2299ms          2050ms   <- video
//     front_yard_left      2501ms          2437ms   <- video
//     front_yard_right     2718ms          1923ms   <- video
//     right_side           2667ms          4361ms   <- poster
//     backyard_left        2828ms          1499ms   <- video
//     deck                 3070ms          1540ms   <- video
//     backyard_right       3105ms          1669ms   <- video
//     garage               2904ms          2904ms   <- tie
//
// Video beat the poster on SEVEN OF NINE. HA's poster mechanism is there and
// is doing almost nothing, so the page is simply dark from 425ms until the
// stream starts -- between 1.2 and 4.4 seconds per tile.
//
// THE FIX IS NOT A FASTER FETCH, it is not fetching. The camera strip on the
// home view already keeps a thumbnail of the last frame it saw in
// localStorage (snapCache in hk-base.js). That is a data: URL -- no network, no
// Protect, available at 0ms. This hands it to the player as its poster.
//
// FRESHNESS IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT. The strip can show an old frame
// because it draws an age label over every tile; the cameras page has no such
// label, and a picture of the front door from three hours ago presented as
// live is worse than a black tile. So a cached frame is used ONLY while it is
// under two minutes old -- which is exactly the case where the wait is most
// annoying (you were just looking at the dashboard) and never the case where
// it would mislead. Past that the page behaves exactly as it would without
// this module.
//
// WHAT THIS REACHES INTO, stated plainly: `ha-web-rtc-player` and
// `ha-hls-player` are HA internals, and `posterUrl` is a Lit reactive property
// on them. If HA renames or restructures those, this stops finding them and
// does nothing -- HA's own poster is still set and the page is no worse than
// without it. That is the failure mode this is designed for; it never replaces
// anything of HA's except a poster it is about to lose the race on anyway.
