// hk-tap.js - holds a tap "active" look on momentary tiles (scene pills).
//
// Scenes, scripts and playlist buttons have no on-state to settle into, so a
// press has to leave its own trace. CSS :active dies with the finger, so the
// pill would flash for however long the tap lasted and no longer. This module
// adds .hk-tapped to the pressed ha-card and holds it for HOLD_MS, which is
// also exactly how long the progress ring in cards/hk-tile.js (the scene
// pill's `--hk-tap` opt-in) takes to sweep once round the icon.
//
// Opt-in is by marker: a template declares `--hk-tap: 1` on its ha-card and we
// read it back off the computed style. Nothing else is inspected, so this can
// never touch a card that did not ask for it.

  // ------------------------------------------------- TAP vs SCROLL
  //
  // The held state cannot simply go on at `pointerdown`. On a wall tablet that
  // would be right -- a finger touching a pill is a tap. On a PHONE it is
  // wrong most of the time: the page is many screens tall, so the
  // overwhelmingly common thing a finger does to a pill is push it out of the
  // way. The pill would flip to its solid-white ACTIVE plate and HOLD it for
  // 1,050ms while the page scrolled out from under it, which reads as "I just
  // launched that scene".
  //
  // A touch is ambiguous at the moment it lands and stays ambiguous until the
  // finger either moves or lifts, so the only correct behavior is to WAIT:
  //
  //   * mouse            -- unambiguous, applied immediately.
  //   * touch / pen      -- applied ON POINTERUP, and only if the finger never
  //                         traveled more than SLOP.
  //   * moved past SLOP  -- a drag. Never applied; and if it was already
  //                         applied (mouse), taken back off.
  //   * pointercancel    -- the browser has taken the gesture for scrolling.
  //
  // WHY POINTERUP AND NOT A SHORT TIMER. A 90ms delay is not good enough: on
  // a phone flick, Safari can take longer than 90ms to decide it is
  // scrolling, so the class goes on, the ring starts its sweep, and
  // pointercancel then takes it off again -- a started-and-aborted animation.
  // A timer can only ever shorten that window, never close it.
  //
  // Waiting for the lift closes it, and closing it costs nothing here, because
  // THE SCENE RUNS ON THE LIFT TOO: tap_action fires from `click`, which is
  // dispatched after pointerup. Starting on the press would show the ring
  // BEFORE the thing it reports has happened; this way feedback coincides
  // with the action instead of anticipating it, and the 1,050ms hold and the
  // sweep are the same once it starts.
  //
  // A press-and-hold shows nothing until release. That is correct for these
  // cards: every one of them sets `hold_action: none`, so a hold has no
  // meaning to report.
  var SLOP = 10;               // px of travel that means "this is a drag"
  var gesture = null;          // { card, id, x, y, applied }

  // --hk-ring is animated from 0deg to 360deg by the conic-gradient that draws
  // the ring. An UNREGISTERED custom property is just a token stream and cannot
  // be interpolated - it would jump 0 -> 360 at the halfway mark - so it has to
  // be registered as an <angle>. @property inside a shadow-root stylesheet is
  // not reliably honored, hence doing it here at document scope.

  // ------------------------------------------------- KILL THE TAP HIGHLIGHT
  //
  // Android WebView paints a gray rounded box over whatever was touched, and on
  // a wall tablet it lands on every chip, every tile and the header clock --
  // a flat gray rectangle with the wrong radius, over a design built on glass.
  //
  // It comes from HA's own frontend, not from us:
  //
  //     partial-panel-resolver, ha-sidebar {
  //       -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  //     }
  //
  // in home-assistant-main's ADOPTED stylesheet. The property is inherited, and
  // partial-panel-resolver is the ancestor of the whole view, so everything
  // below it inherits that color -- which is why a document-level
  // `html { ... }` rule does nothing: inheritance restarts there and wins.
  //
  // So the override has to go into the same shadow root. Appending a
  // constructable sheet leaves HA's own styles intact and needs no element to
  // still exist when we run.
  //
  // NOT `user-select: none` as well: text selection is already off on the cards
  // and turning it off globally would break the code editors in Settings.
