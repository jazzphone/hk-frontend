// hk-loader.js - imports the order-independent dashboard modules (MODULES
// below: kiosk, stats, charts, sky, idle, viewfade, glass, timers, saver,
// campost, menu, tabbar).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// The bootstrap list -- the files every page loads before any card renders --
// is registered by custom_components/hk_frontend/__init__.py
// (add_extra_js_url), and changing THAT LIST needs a Home Assistant restart.
// This file is one entry in it, and adding a module HERE is live on the next
// page load: /hk/ is served with Cache-Control: no-cache, so every file
// revalidates (ETag -> 304) and an edit to any of them is live on a refresh.
//
// WHAT BELONGS IN HERE: modules that do nothing at load time except assign a
// window global (window.hkSky, window.hkStats, ...), which cards read lazily
// while rendering -- so the imports can run in parallel, in any order.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT: the other bootstrap entries in __init__.py, which must run
// BEFORE the first card renders --
//   hk-settings.js    the dashboard settings every page reads at first paint;
//   hk-icons.js       registers the hk: iconset (ha-icon caches a miss for the
//                     life of the page, so it cannot be late);
//   tesla-viewport.js pins the layout width in a car browser (late = a reflow);
//   hk-tap.js         registers --hk-ring as an <angle> before the first tap;
//   hk-header.js      the header builders, painted first.
//
// Before adding a module here, check it has nothing to do before first render.
