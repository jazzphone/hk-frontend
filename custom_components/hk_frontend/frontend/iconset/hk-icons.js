// TIMING. The iconset is registered SYNCHRONOUSLY at module evaluation -- that
// is the whole defence against ha-icon's sticky blank (see the repair shim
// below): ha-icon only tests that the set EXISTS at first render. The glyph
// data is fetched from the same evaluation, in parallel, and the getter
// awaits it; ha-icon already awaits the getter, so a first icon can at most
// wait for that one fetch, which starts before any card has loaded.

// Three facts combine into a permanent blank icon:
//   1. Lovelace resources are injected as <script async type="module">, so the
//      "hk" iconset may not exist yet when a card first renders.
//   2. On a miss, ha-icon sets _legacy = true and renders <iron-icon>, which
//      has no "hk" iconset either, so it draws nothing.
//   3. _loadIcon() only re-runs when the `icon` PROPERTY CHANGES, and the
//      custom-icon success path never clears _legacy. So one lost race blanks
//      that element for the life of the page - which is exactly why a reload
//      sometimes fixes it and sometimes does not.
//
// There is no iconset-added event in this frontend (grepped every chunk),
// so nothing tells the already-rendered elements to try again. This does.
//
// _legacy and _loadIcon are private, but both survive minification as class
// members and are guarded below; a rename would make this a no-op, not a break.

  // for the life of the page would run forever on a wall tablet.

  // the async getIcon resolving). So the failure this repairs can only happen
  // to elements that rendered BEFORE this module evaluated. That is a closed
  // window, not an ongoing risk.
  //
  // So the poll switches itself off: after QUIET_SWEEPS consecutive clean
  // sweeps it stops, and anything that could plausibly introduce a
  // pre-registration element again -- a navigation, coming back from the
  // screensaver -- re-arms it. A page that genuinely keeps losing icons keeps
