  // ======================================================= SPEAKER PICKER
  // The Play Music page's speaker selection. Same shape as HkAreaSelectCard
  // above -- a card-local Set, nothing written to HA until you press a
  // playlist -- and for the same reason: which rooms you want music in right
  // now is a per-screen choice that lasts seconds. It is not global state and
  // two tablets must not share it. See that card's header.
  //
  // WHY THE PLAYLIST TILES LIVE INSIDE THIS CARD.
  // A separate card cannot read this one's Set, so the action that
  // consumes the selection has to sit with it -- exactly how Clean/Clear
  // sit with the area pills. It also reads better: pick rooms, pick music,
  // one gesture.
  //
  // HOW A SELECTION BECOMES A PLAYER (the whole design, in three rules):
  //   1. selection == a preset's set  -> that preset's player, which is a
  //      REAL MUSIC ASSISTANT SYNC GROUP. Presets such as Everywhere and
  //      Downstairs keep using MA's own saved sync, which is the best sync
  //      available.
  //   2. selection == exactly one speaker -> that speaker.
  //   3. anything else (an ad-hoc subset of 2+) -> a temporary join of
  //      those speakers.

    // selection that says "3 speakers" and plays to two, a silent partial
    // success.
    // A missing entity also cannot be trusted as a playback target. Once HA

  // hk-browse-card -- Music Assistant's own web UI, inside a dashboard page.
  //
  // WHY A CARD AND NOT A PAGE. A standalone page holding one iframe and a
  // "Close" button that calls window.close() does not work, for two reasons:
  //
  //   1. window.close() CANNOT CLOSE A PAGE THE SCRIPT DID NOT OPEN. A page
  //      reached by in-place navigation (`location.href = ...`) is not one,
  //      so Close does nothing at all, and on a kiosk tablet with no browser
  //      chrome there is no way back.
  //   2. It is outside the dashboard: no back chevron, no theme, no sky, and
  //      a full page load to reach it.
  //
  // As a subview it gets the same back chevron as every other page, which
  // cannot strand anybody, and the whole class of problem disappears.
  //
  // THE URL IS DERIVED, NOT HARDCODED. A literal
  // `http://<music-assistant-host>:8095` only works from that one address.
  // Music Assistant runs on the same host as Home Assistant on a different
  // port, so the host comes from wherever this page was served and only the
  // port is configuration. Any tablet reaching HA by any name or address
  // reaches MA the same way.
  //
  // MIXED CONTENT IS SAID OUT LOUD. MA serves plain HTTP. An HTTP frame inside
  // an HTTPS page is blocked by the browser with no visible error -- the
  // symptom is an empty rectangle, which looks like a broken flow but is
  // not. (Browse Music itself is hk-library-card, which has no frame.) So
