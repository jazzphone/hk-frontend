  // ======================================================================
  // hk-camera-mosaic-card -- the Home app's camera strip, as one joined mosaic.
  //
  // ONE CARD, NOT A CONDITIONAL PER CAMERA. "Which camera is live" as
  // `state:` / `state_not:` conditionals is two per camera and hundreds of
  // hand-maintained lines. This resolves it at render time from the
  // selector, the same move hk-control.js makes for the Play Music page.
  //
  // THE PATTERN, measured off the Home app on an iPad:
  // equal-width columns, alternating ONE full-height tile and TWO stacked
  // half-height tiles, at 4:3 per column (measured w/h 1.320 and 1.325 on the
  // two full columns). The stacked tiles are a 4:3 column split in two.
  //
  //   [ live 16:9 ][ still ][ still ][ still ][ still ]
  //   [  360x203  ][-------][ 4:3   ][-------][ 4:3   ]
  //   [  slot 1   ][ still ][ full  ][ still ][ full  ]
  //
  // SLOT 1 IS DELIBERATELY NOT 4:3. The Home app crops its featured tile to
  // 4:3, which on a 16:9 feed throws away ~25% of the width -- and on many
  // cameras the sides carry real coverage. So the live tile keeps its full
  // 16:9 at 360x202.5. Only the stills take the 4:3 crop.
  //
  // THE STRIP MUST KEEP SCROLLING, and this is a performance constraint rather
  // than a style choice. MEASURED on a 4GB Android wall tablet: HA fetches
  // camera snapshots ONLY for cameras visible in the scroller -- 4 distinct
  // cameras at scrollLeft 0, 8 after scrolling to the end of a 3348px strip
  // in a 1265px row. Tile size changes nothing, because HA serves the
  // source-resolution snapshot whatever box it is drawn in. So the number of
  // cameras ON SCREEN *is* the fetch load. A mosaic sized to fit all nine at
  // once would take that from 4 to 9 permanently. At 270px columns this
  // shows ~6 in the same 1265px where a plain row of cards shows ~3.4 --
  // more cameras for a smaller increase, with the dial still in your hands.
  //
  // ONE PLATE, NOT NINE CARDS. The mosaic reads as a single object because the
  // radius and the shadow live on the plate and the tiles are clipped by it:
  //   - `overflow:hidden` + `border-radius` rounds the GROUP's outer corners;
  //   - `--ha-card-border-radius:0` squares every interior corner. Custom
  //     properties cross the shadow boundary, which is what makes this reach
  //     into each picture-entity without card_mod (a mosaic built on
  //     card_mod renders as a plain stack wherever it is not installed,
  //     because the CSS applies to nothing);
  //   - `--ha-card-box-shadow:none` stops nine shadows overlapping in the 2px
  //     seams. The plate carries the SAME `0 8px 22px` the theme uses, so
  //     the shadow's reach is unchanged and hk-row-card's pad/margin numbers
  //     (14/22/30/22 and the matching negative margin) do NOT move.
  //   - the seams show the plate's own dark background rather than the page.
  //     That is deliberately unlike iOS, whose page is always dark: our sky is
  //     bright in daytime and a transparent seam would cut a bright line
  //     through the mosaic.

  // A CUSTOM EDITOR, because ha-form cannot express this config. The scalars
  // (selector, height, seam) are a plain schema and go through hkEditor like
  // every other card here; the CAMERA LIST is an ordered list of objects with
  // add / remove / move, and `ha-form` has no selector for that.
  //
  // Built from plain <select>/<input>/<button> rather than ha-entity-picker and
  // friends. Those are nicer, but they are HA frontend internals with no
  // compatibility promise, and depending on undocumented behaviour has
  // cost this file before. A dropdown of camera entities is enough for a
  // strip of cameras.
  //
  // THE `option` FIELD IS A DROPDOWN OF THE SELECTOR'S OWN OPTIONS, not free
  // text. It has to match what the selector reports or that camera can
  // never be the live one -- a typo there fails silently and looks like a
  // broken camera. Reading the options off the entity makes it unmissable.

  // ======================================================================
  // hk-doorbell-card -- the #doorbell sheet: the front door, live, WITH its
  // sound, and a hold-to-talk button.
  //
  // WHY THIS CARD OWNS ITS OWN WEBRTC. With a stock picture-entity the
  // door's audio never plays. HA's player asks for a MUTED stream, and
  // although the doorbell sends Opus (the answer offers it and the packets
  // arrive -- ~340 KB in a minute, measured in Chrome), ha-web-rtc-player
  // leaves the audio track out of its <video>. Unmuting ha-camera-stream
  // does not help: it swaps to the HLS player, seconds behind and paused
  // until a tap. So this card negotiates through HA's public camera API
  // itself (camera/webrtc/get_client_config, camera/webrtc/offer and
  // /candidate -- the messages the frontend's own player sends) and plays
  // both tracks in one <video>: audio + video, connected in about a second.
  //
  // SOUND starts muted, because autoplay always allows that, and then tries
  // to unmute. With Fully Kiosk's "Autoplay audio" on, that sticks with no
  // tap. A browser that refuses pauses the video instead, so the card mutes
  // again, keeps playing, and the speaker button shows the sound is off: one
  // tap turns it on.
  //
  // TALK: hold and speak, and the words stream live to `speaker` (a UniFi
  // Protect doorbell, through talk_live.py) -- or, anywhere that cannot,
  // they are recorded and played through talk.py when the button is let go.
  // A press is one or the other, never both (see s.fail in _liveStart). The
  // microphone needs a secure page (https), so on plain http the button is
  // not drawn at all. While the button is held the door's sound is muted, so
  // the tablet does not record its own speaker.

  // start listening before it goes on as a clip instead.

  // WebRTC camera card, with `fill` and a tuning message). While it is open:
  //   * ws `hk_tv/watching` every 60 s names this screen as a viewer, and
  //     the viewers sensor carries it to a tablet's sleep logic, which can
  //     keep the tablet on its dashboard;
  //   * hkIdle holds, so a subview is not abandoned mid-show;
  //   * the controls fade after a few seconds and come back on a touch.
  // Closing (X, Escape, or leaving the page) stops all three and drops the
